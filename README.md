## Introduction
The FIFA World Cup is one of the most prestigious international soccer tournaments. This project aims to investigate whether a country's population has any influence on its performance in the World Cup. By analyzing historical data, we will explore trends and patterns and assess if there is a correlation between population size and success in the tournament.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about World Cup matches, teams, and country populations. The dataset includes details such as match results, team performances, and population figures over the years.

## Analysis
The analysis involves several steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure its suitability for analysis.
2. Exploratory data analysis: Exploring the relationship between population size and various performance metrics, such as win percentage, goals scored, and tournament progress.
3. Statistical analysis: Conducting statistical tests to determine the significance of any observed correlations or patterns.
4. Data visualization: Creating visualizations, such as plots and charts, to present the findings effectively.

## Results
Based on the analysis conducted, we will summarize the key findings and conclusions regarding the relationship between country population and World Cup performance. The results will help provide insights into whether population size has any influence on a country's success in the tournament.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the analysis code:
- Python (version 3.9.13)
- Pandas (version 1.4.4)
- NumPy (version 1.21.5)
